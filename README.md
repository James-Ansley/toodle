Toodle (toml moodle) is a small transpiler that converts human-readable text and
TOML file formats representing Moodle questions to Moodle XML.

Moodle TOML also supports the Coderunner question type.

> Note: Moodle TOML is in alpha and significant API changes are likely.
> Currently, only Coderunner python questions, multi choice, and short answers
> are supported
